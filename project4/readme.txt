Project 4 by Haotian HE for LING 473

August 31, 2013

Language: Java

Approach: I mainly created a basic Trie class and several methods to solve this problem.

1. uses BufferedInputStream to read all files.

2. uses Scanner to read targets files and add it to the tree line by line. Move the current nodes to add the letters up with if/else statements (judging whether the position is right).

3. creates a hash map to search the Trie for a match in the DNA files, and also uses a Hashtable structure to keep the information.

Results:

As the output.txt shows.
